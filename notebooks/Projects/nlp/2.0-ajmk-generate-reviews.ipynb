       "       'been going to dr goldberg for over years i think i was one of his st patients when he started at mhmg hes been great over the years and is really all about the big picture it is because of him not my now former gyn dr markoff that i found out i have fibroids he explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding he doesnt judge and asks all the right questions very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life',\n",
       "       'i dont know what dr goldberg was like before moving to arizona but let me tell you stay away from this doctor and this office i was going to dr johnson before he left and goldberg took over when johnson left he is not a caring doctor he is only interested in the copay and having you come in for medication refills every month he will not give refills and could less about patientss financial situations trying to get your days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke and to make matters even worse his office staff is incompetent of the time when you call the office theyll put you through to a voice mail that no one ever answers or returns your call both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration the entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor give me a break stay away from this doc and the practice you deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them i have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until i met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money',\n",
       "       'im writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this doctor the office staff and administration are very unprofessional i left a message with multiple people regarding my bill and no one ever called me back i had to hound them to get an answer about my bill nnsecond and most important make sure your insurance is going to cover dr goldbergs visits and blood work he recommended to me that i get a physical and he knew i was a student because i told him i got the physical done later i found out my health insurance doesnt pay for preventative visits i received an bill for the blood work i cant pay for my bill because im a student and dont have any cash flow at this current time i cant believe the doctor wouldnt give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasnt necessary and was strictly preventative the office cant do anything to help me cover the bill in addition the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits frustrating situation',\n",

       "       'before i finally made it over to this range i heard the same thing from most people its just fine to go work on your swing i had such a low expectation i was pleasantly surprised nnits a fairly big range if you are familiar with scallys in moon it seems like it has almost as many tees though its not nearly as nice a facility nnthe guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys ive come across at ranges or at courses yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for and even some hazards to aim away from nna big red flag to me was the extra charge to hit off the grass i am no range expert but this is the th one ive been to and the first ive seen of that sort of nickel and dimingnnprice for the golf balls was reasonable and i do plan to be back every week until they close up in october for the season hopefully since its for sale it will reopen as a golf facility again',\n",
